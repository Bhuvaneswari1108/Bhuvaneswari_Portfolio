Data Science Portfolio
# Introduction
* I'm Bhuvaneswari Vallagachu, currently pursing my masters in data science at University of New Haven.
* I completed my bachelor's in computer science stream from Acharya Nagarjuna University with an aggregate of 8.45 on a scale of 10.
* I'm interested to learn deep learning, machine learning and gain real time experience. 
# [Project 1 : Colon Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/Bhuvaneswari1108/Bhuvaneswari_Portfolio)
* It is basically the utilization of machine learning techniques for the order of classification of colon cancer detection depending on the variation of the gene expression. 
* Additionally, It is an examination to discover the dependability of the most significant gene expression or patterns in the given micro array dataset.
* Scikit learn library of python is used to code the algorithm
* Extra tree classifier is a feature selection algorithm used to extract the important features from the microarray dataset.
* Out of 2000 gene features, it selected the top 33 gene features .
* Supervised machine learning models like SVM, Logistic regression are fed with the top 33 gene features to classify the data into 2 classes, detected and not detected, 
* Out of all, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane, outperformed with an accuracy of 98%. 
* I'm further interested to extend the project using deep learning and optimization techniques.
