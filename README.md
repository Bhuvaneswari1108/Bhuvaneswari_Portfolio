# Project 1 : Colon Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms
* It is basically the utilization of machine learning techniques for the order of classification of colon cancer detection depending on the variation of the gene expression. 
* Additionally, It is an examination to discover the dependability of the most significant gene expression or patterns in the given micro array dataset.
* Scikit learn library of python is used to code the algorithm
* Extra tree classifier is a feature selection algorithm used to extract the important features from 2000 gene features of microarray dataset.
* Support vector machine is a supervised Machine Learning model used to classify the data into 2 classes, detected and not detected.
